# 👋 Hello! Nice to see you around here!

Welcome to my repository where I'm sharing a collection of exercises focused on the **fundamentals of programming**.

---

## 🧠 What's inside?

Here you'll find practice materials and examples covering essential programming concepts using the **Python** language:

- ✅ Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- 🔁 Loops (`for`, `while`)
- ✂️ String manipulations
- 🧮 Basic logic and algorithmic thinking

## 🚀 Goal

I'm practicing every day, so over time this repository will:

- Become more **organized**
- Contain even more **useful exercises**
- Hopefully turn into a valuable **learning resource**

## 💬 Feel free to explore

If you're also learning programming, I hope this helps you too! 😄  
Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.
